## Installation: 
1. Download Zip and Extract it. There’s a demo sketch file and a SketchToVR.sketchplugin.
2. Double click on SketchToVR.sketchplugin. Sketch will install the plugin.

## Export your mocks with the plugin 
1. Open the demo Sketch file. The “background” artboard is a 360° photo. The “ui” artboard is the interface on top of the photo. In order to be seamless, the 360° photo you use should be [equirectangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection). There are some examples on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/). The one in my file is from [Nick Hobgood](https://www.flickr.com/photos/globalvoyager/27869867466/).
2. Go to Plugins > Sketch to VR > Export. The export may be slow due to the size of the 360° photo.

## View your mocks in VR 
1. The exported folder will be used to run [A-Frame, an open-source Web VR library developed](https://aframe.io/) by [MozVR](https://mozvr.com/). It needs a local server to work (simply opening the HTML page will not work). I recommend the [SimpleHTTPServer by Scott Garner](http://www.scottmadethis.net/interactive/simpleserver/). Right click on the exported folder and choose SimpleHTTPServer. Use click & drag to navigate.
2. To preview on your phone with a Cardboard, there are a few options. If you own a website, just upload this folder to your website and access the URL from your phone. Or you can use [Chrome port forwarding](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/remote-debugging/local-server?hl=en) to open localhost:8000 on your phone (initial page load may be slow due to the size of the 360° photo). Tap on the bottom right Cardboard icon to switch to VR mode!

## Troubleshooting
- If you use your own sketch files, make sure to name your artboards “background” and “ui”.
- If you get a system prompt dialog while using SimpleHTTPServer, choose Allow. 
- If you get some console errors and can’t see anything on the web page, restart the browser.
- If you created your own photo / UI, you may need to go into the index.html file to adjust the dimension of the images. [Read more about A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/0.2.0/guide/).
